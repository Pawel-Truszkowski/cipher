# Cipher Encryption Application

## General Info
This project is a command-line application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using ROT13 and ROT47 ciphers. 
The program provides options for saving encrypted/decrypted messages to text or JSON files and reading saved messages from these files. 
The application is organized following SOLID principles, with modular classes for managing ciphers, message handling, file operations, and user interactions.

## Technologies
- **Python 3.10**: The application is written in Python, utilizing its standard library for file handling, JSON serialization, and basic encoding functions.
- **pytest**: Unit testing is done with `pytest` to ensure reliability of encryption and decryption functionality.
- **JSON**: Messages are stored in JSON format, allowing for structured and human-readable storage of encrypted data.
- **OOP Principles**: The application uses abstract base classes and SOLID principles to organize code in a modular and reusable manner.
